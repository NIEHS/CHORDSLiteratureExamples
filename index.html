<h3>Introduction</h3>
This collection of case studies is intended to provide examples of research articles that examine the health effects of wildfire-related exposures and highlight the key climate, environment, and health data sets used in these studies. We aimed to include studies that integrated a diverse range of exposure data, such as satellite and surface monitoring data, and health data sources, such as administrative, pharmaceutical, and syndromic surveillance data.

                This example demonstrates how researchers have utilized remotely sensed and ground based monitoring data to model wildfire-related exposures and link these estimates to population-level health outcome data.
               
                <h3>Summary:</h3>
            O’Neill et al. (2021) conducted a simulation of air quality conditions using a suite of remotely-sensed data, surface observational data, chemical transport modeling, data fusion and machine learning methods to estimate PM2.5 concentrations from five major Northern California wildfires that occurred in October 2017. Resulting PM2.5 exposure estimates were then linked with the CDC WONDER database to conduct a health impact analysis and estimate mortality attributable to wildfire smoke

                This example demonstrates how researchers have linked wildfire smoke exposure data with health outcome data, for a pediatric population, across a seven-year study period. Researchers utilized health data from a single hospital network allowing for linkages across a longer study period compared to previous studies.

                 <h3>Summary:</h3>
                Aguilera et al. (2021) examined associations between wildfire smoke exposures and pediatric visits for respiratory outcomes from 2011 – 2017 in San Diego County, California. Pediatric ED and urgent care respiratory visit data were obtained from a hospital network which provided medical care for 91% of the County’s hospitalized children. Primary health outcomes were assessed using chief complaints (difficulty breathing, respiratory distress, wheezing, asthma, or cough). These health data were linked with wildfire-specific fine PM2.5 and studied using modeled daily concentrations at the zip code level over a longer study period of seven years and larger area compared to previous studies.

            This example demonstrates how researchers have used both state and national data sources to study wildfire-related exposures and human health outcomes. Local PM2.5 levels were linked with state level hospital data for respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes.
            <h3>Summary:</h3>
            Alman et al. (2016) examined associations between local PM2.5 levels and emergency department (ED) visits for respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes during the 2012 Colorado wildfires (June 5, 2012 – July 6, 2012). Health outcome data were obtained from the Colorado Dept of Public Health. Hospitalizations and ED visits for six respiratory and seven cardiovascular outcomes were identified using ICD 9 codes. Hourly PM2.5 concentrations were modeled using Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Patient addresses were geocoded to 12 km grids and linked to exposure estimates.

<b>The Association of Wildfire Smoke with Respiratory and Cardiovascular Emergency Department Visits in Colorado in 2012: a Case Crossover Study</b><br><br>

            This example demonstrates the use of statewide syndromic surveillance data to study wildfire smoke exposures and emergency department (ED) visits. Syndromic surveillance data may be available in near real-time and this data sources provides an opportunity to identify wildfire-related health conditions of interest. 
            <h3>Summary:</h3>

            Rappold et al. (2011) investigated effects of exposure to peat wildfire smoke on cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes. ED visit data were obtained from a statewide syndromic surveillance program, the North Carolina Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool (NC DETECT). Aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from NOAA’s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) were used to determine exposure windows and areas most impacted by smoke plumes. Satellite data and syndromic surveillance data were combined to compare ED visits on high exposure days and in high exposure areas to those with lower exposure.

            <br>
            This article demonstrates the use of state level vital statistics records for a study investigating the impact of wildfire smoke exposures during pregnancy on infant birth weight. The vital statistics records included population data for the study area which were used to create comparison groups of unexposed births from before and after the wildfire. 

            <h3>Summary:</h3>
            Holstius et al. (2012) assessed the impact of wildfire-related exposures during pregnancy on infant birth weight. They obtained vital records data from the California Center for Health Statistics for singleton term births and compared infant birth weights from pregnancies that took place entirely before or after the 2003 southern California wildfires. Exposure windows were defined using reports from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and MODIS satellite imagery. Satellite images were also used to determine geographic locations impacted by the fires. Exposure windows and geographic areas were linked to gestational stages and mother’s place of residence, from vital records, to determine pregnancies exposed to the wildfires.

Prescription data were obtained from the British Columbia Ministry of Health’s PharmaNet database which is a system that captures prescription information in real-time.
              <h3>Summary:</h3>

              Yao et al. (2016) estimated the effects of wildfire smoke-related PM2.5 on counts of respiratory-related medication dispensations and cardiorespiratory outpatient physician visits. Information on medication dispensations and physician visits were obtained from the BC PharmaNet database and Medical Services Plan billings database. PM2.5 was measured and modeled using data from the BC Ministry of Environment Air Monitoring Network, along with NASA MODIS satellite imagery and NOAA Hazard Mapping System to determine extreme fire days and hot spots.
